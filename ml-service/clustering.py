"""
clustering.py — groups passengers moving together into bus clusters.

Why DBSCAN and not K-Means:
- K-Means needs you to say upfront how many buses are running. We don't know.
- DBSCAN finds however many groups exist naturally.
- DBSCAN labels lone outliers as -1 (noise) — car drivers, stationary people.
  K-Means would force them into a cluster incorrectly.
